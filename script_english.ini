2000="Hmm, it seems another otxo has washed up on our shores."
2001="It's been a few years since the last one."
2002="Let me guess, you found the mask somewhere, you were compelled to put it on, you don't really remember after that..."
2003="Then you ended up here, face down in the sand.  Is that right?"
2004="It's always the same. You had someone with you as well."
2005="Your beloved, from the looks of it."
2006="They're deep inside the Mansion now, if you intend to find them."
2007="But hold on, don't just go rushing in there yet. You'll be killed instantly."
2008="Let me at least explain how things work around here:"
2009="First of all, don't bother trying to leave. You can't."
2010="And don't bother trying to kill yourself either."
2011="You can't truly die while you're wearing the mask. You'll just end up back on this beach."
2012="And you can't release the mask until you've destroyed the heart of the Mansion."
2013="Only then can you be free. Make sense?"
2014="Lovely. Now then, why don't we make sure you can handle yourself in there?"
2015="Come with me."

2016="The first thing you need to understand is kicking."
2017="The doors in the Mansion are locked, even to your adversaries who patrol it."
2018="You can get them open by kicking them, firing enough into them, or by detonating an explosive nearby."
2019="I'd recommend kicking.  Walk up to the door and deliver a swift kick and it should shatter right open."

2020="Your foes inside the Mansion will be seeking to stop you from progressing."
2021="To that end they'll fire upon you with all manner of weaponry."
2022="Your only recourse is, of course, to shoot back."
2023="You can borrow my old service rifle. Take some shots at these targets."
2024="If you run out of ammo, you can always reload with a fresh magazine."
2025="If you're out of magazines you'll have to find a new gun. Or kick your enemies to death."

2026="This is probably the most important thing I can tell you, so pay attention."
2027="Your adversaries inside the Mansion will have extremely high reaction time."
2028="However, thanks to that mask, you do have a leg-up on them."
2029="You can activate an ability called Focus, which heightens your senses and allows you to move faster than them."
2030="Try activating Focus and slipping your way through the bullets coming from this turret."
2031="You can also roll, which will allow you to dodge bullets as they fly over you."

2032="Alright, just one last thing."
2033="As you kill your enemies, you may notice that you gain a combo meter."
2034="The combo meter goes up if you're killing enemies quickly or in interesting ways."
2035="This is extremely important, especially if you intend to make it to the end:"
2036="Enemies will drop more coin if you have a combo going."
2037="If you're going too slowly and not keeping up a combo, they won't drop much at all."
2038="So, for your sake, try to move quickly. Don't be afraid of your foes."
2039="Alright, go ahead and face off against some actual enemies in this next section."
2040="I'll be waiting for you at the end."
2041="Remember, use Focus. It's the only advantage you have."

2042="Well, you're as ready as you're going to be."
2043="Time for the real thing. Good luck. And say hello to the bartender for me."

2044="You have probably noticed a few new faces out here."
2045="We are the servants of the Mansion."
2046="We consist of various wanderers, vagabonds, and transients that have somehow wound up here."
2047="And unlike you otxo, it seems that there is no chance we can ever leave."
2048="..."
2049="Ah, don't worry. We've all made peace with it one way or another."
2050="I suppose I should introduce myself.  I am the Groundskeeper."
2051="I mostly tend to the Mansion's horticulture, but I've become somewhat of a defacto caretaker for all."
2052="Likely because I've been here the longest... well, in a sense."
2053="I get the feeling the bartender and that girl with him have been here much, much longer."
2054="But they seem to be content staying within the Rose Room, so we don't see them often."
2055="Anyways, I won't keep you from your purpose any longer."
2056="Good luck in there, and if you need anything from me, I'll be here."

2057="Ah, trying again, are we Otxo?"
2058="I hope your luck is better this time..."

2059="You know, we aren't the only ones."
2060="There's beings in there absorbed by the Mansion's power, their minds twisted and weak."
2061="My master is one of them. He taught me everything I know about horticulture..."
2062="But there's no saving him now. He's too far gone."

2063="A long time ago, a great hunter arrived on these shores and entered the Mansion."
2064="Unlike others brought to this place unwillingly, it seemed he had come here with intention."
2065="He was a large man of few words but he mentioned something about black saurian-beasts."
2066="He said that he had travelled worlds in order to slay them, that that was his purpose."
2067="Anyways, he never returned to the beach after he entered."
2068="I can't say what happened, but if he's still in there, there's no chance his mind is his own."

2069="Do you believe in ghosts, Otxo?"
2070="I know it's a strange question when we're in a place like this."
2071="But I've seen things in the Mansion that don't fit the rules of this world."
2072="Certainly makes a man wonder."

2073="Have you been to the conservatory?"
2074="At one time that was my pride and joy, a true melding of man and nature in a handful of beautiful rooms..."
2075="Of course my days caring for the conservatory are long gone."
2076="I don't dare enter the Mansion now, lest the husks tear me apart."

2077="You don't sleep."
2078="I know cause I don't either. In fact nobody here does."
2079="Been that way for a long time."

2080="In my time here there hasn't been an otxo quite like you."
2081="You're different... I don't know how, but you're different."
2082="Maybe it's because you still think you can make it. We'll see if that lasts."

2083="Going for it again are we?"
2084="Well, here's hoping that you're successful this time."

2085="That bartender is an interesting fellow isn't he?"
2086="He's not quite like the rest of us. I think it's because we're not from here."
2087="And I get the impression that maybe he is."
2088="Regardless, he serves a strong drink, so I've got not complaints."

2089="At one point the Mansion used to have a beautiful flower bed surrounding it."
2090="Petunias, marigolds, tulips, orchids, and carnations."
2091="A splendid circle of lillies..."
2092="Now it's all I can do to keep the grass at bay and handle the few potted plants."
2093="It's not quite what it once was."

2094="Are you familiar with the lotus flower?"
2095="In some cultures it represents the path to enlightenment."
2096="In others, it's the path from death to rebirth in the afterlife."
2097="..."
2098="Lotus grows here, you know. In the ponds in the conservatory."

2099="It's hard to grow much of anything here outside the Mansion."
2100="The salt from the ocean has permeated the soil. Makes it hard for roots to grow strong."
2101="The grass does ok, but it grows in low."
2102="At one time I worked hard to keep the Mansion beautiful..."
2103="But those days have long since passed. Now I just do what I'm able."

2104="This ocean is a calm one. No rogue waves, no flooding."
2105="The tide never changes either."
2106="Of course, that's because the time never changes."
2107="Always eternally sunset. Beautiful, eh?"

2108="This place never changes much."
2109="It's been a long time since the last otxo, I think we were all starting to get bored."
2110="At least you're someone who hasn't heard me talk before."

2111="Do you grow tired of this otxo?"
2112="I did at first... but time continued on, and now I simply exist in a comfortable state."
2113="My purpose is here, to care for the plants and to care for the people."
2114="All it required was some acceptance."

2115="Could I bum a cigarette, Otxo?"
2116="..."
2117="Oh sorry, I forgot. Heh."

2118="You know, for a long time I was just here by myself."
2119="Even with the others here, it's quite a pleasure to have your company."
2120="Temporary as it may be."

2121="You know Otxo, I haven't said this to any others, but..."
2122="Of all the otxos we've had, I think you're my favorite."
2123="There's something in your eyes. I can't explain it."
2124="But I can see that you're more determined than anyone else."

2125="Sometimes, when the wind is still and the waves are quiet, I sit out here and calm my breathing."
2126="And in that silence, after a time, I can begin to hear a heartbeat that isn't my own."
2127="It sounds like it comes from deep within the Mansion, but who could say..."
2128="Have you heard it, Otxo?"

2129="You know, I've been in the Mansion a few times, looking for the Master."
2130="But whenever I go inside it's completely empty... except for the bar, of course."

2131="You've met that girl in the bar, yeah?"
2132="She's... unusual. A strange girl. Beautiful though."
2133="More beautiful than this Mansion deserves, to be frank."

2134="This Mansion... it needs control, you know?"
2135="It fears chaos. You can feel it when you enter."
2136="You seek to shake up that control, don't you Otxo?"

2137="I won't lie to you Otxo. Some days I grow tired of this."
2138="The monotony of existing in this place..."
2139="But then someone like you comes along and it's suddenly not so drab any longer."

2140="For a time I tried to grow trees around the Mansion, but they never took root."
2141="I don't know if it was just the hard conditions out here or what."
2142="It's a real shame. Some beautiful willows shading the Mansion would be a nice touch."

2143="When I first came here I tended to a bonsai tree."
2144="It was meditative, carefully clipping the branches, shaping it to my desire..."
2145="But like all things in the Mansion, it eventually grew brown and hollow, rotted from the inside out."
2146="I did my best to save it but nothing seemed to help."
2147="I never tried to grow another one after that."

3500="Oy."
3501="Can I help you, sea-wolf?"
3502="I'm hard up in a clinch, with no knife to cut the seizing."
3503="I've got to get this dinghy repaired so I can get off this god-forsaken beach."
3504="I don't pay heed to what that blasted groundskeeper says, I'm going to find my way out of here."
3505="..."
3506="Aye, sorry lad. I'm just beginning to forget how long I've been here."
3507="I thought it was only a few weeks ago that I washed up here but... maybe it was months?"
3508="What a lubberly soul I've become..."

3509="What ocean claims this beach sea-wolf?"
3510="I had thought myself a well traveled sailor but alas, I don't recognize these waters."
3511="Is the heading of the sun rise even east...?"

3512="This sea isn't like any I've seen."
3513="There's no tides, the waves never change size..."
3514="As a man who has trusted the will of the sea his whole life, I find myself lost."

3515="Lad, I can't recall if I arrived in this dinghy or not."
3516="It doesn't look like it's the one from my ship but it's certainly mine now."
3517="If I can just get it fixed, I think I might be able to row away from here."

3518="Oy sea-wolf. Come to hear my moaning again?"
3519="Heh, sorry. Haven't got much else to do but complain in my predicament."

3520="I've tried walking the length of the beach, and behind the manor as well..."
3521="But every time I end up back here."
3522="So I think the sea has to be the exit. I've tried swimming, of course."
3523="But the waves are just a little too much.  I haven't the strength."
3524="That's why this boat... this dinghy will be my key to get out of here."

3525="Before I was here, I fished every one of the seven seas."
3526="Every season I brought back a plentiful haul."
3527="You ever had a sixteen foot marlin on your line, sea-wolf?"
3528="Hell of a fight to bring it in..."

3529="How long have we been here sea-wolf?"
3530="This eternal sunset muddles the days..."

3531="I can't handle the others on this beach."
3532="They've just accepted their predicament. Weak, I say."
3533="But not I. I was raised by the sea! I'm strong of heart and body."
3534="I'll get off this god-forsaken strip of beach if it kills me."

3535="Do you know how I arrived here, sea-wolf?"
3536="I was navigating my ship and crew through a brutal night squall."
3537="We'd been sailing for days without provisions. Everyone was tired and ragged."
3538="In a flash of lightning I saw a large rock, a stack. I couldn't believe it."
3539="We weren't that close to land, at least, that's what I had thought."
3540="I tried to turn, but it was too late. We collided."
3541="I can't recall much else, but I awoke gasping for breath on this beach..."

3542="That mask you wear..."
3543="You can't take it off, can you sea-wolf?"
3544="I've heard stories of such a curse in my travels, but never seen it in the flesh..."

3545="Oh, Sally Racket, Hi-oh!"
3546="Cheerly, man!"
3547="Pawned my best jacket, Hi-oh!"
3548="Cheerly, man!"
3549="And sold pawn the ticket, Hi-oh!"
3550="Hehe... just an old tune we used to sing."

3551="..."
3552="Ah! Sea-wolf... sorry, I didn't notice you at first."
3553="My mind wanders when I'm staring out at the sea."
3554="Especially in this place..."

3555="Oy..."
3556="You... You've been to the lighthouse, haven't ye?"
3557="I can see it in your eyes. You've been there for sure."
3558="Hmm..."
3559="Here. Let me give you this. It's my old fishing rod."
3560="You seem like you may have a fisherman's eye. Give it a shot."
3561="If you walk up to the edge of the water here, you'll be able to cast your line in."
3562="And if you catch something, you can bring it to the fire over here and cook it."
3563="Nothing beats the taste of fresh caught fish. It's good for the mind and soul."
3564="Oh, you can also only catch one a day. Something to keep in mind."

3565="Despite the utter repugnance of this place, there's life in them waters."
3566="I've seen some fish jumping, and the sea birds are always looking for washed up meals."
3567="Tis a healthy ocean, this one..."

3568="Aye sea-wolf... You've caught me wondering if I'll ever be off this beach..."
3569="I've got to keep trying, I shan't be stuck here..."

3570="You've got a fighter's spirirt haven't ye, sea-wolf?"
3571="The way you carry yourself, the look in your eyes."
3572="Knew many a man like you back in my sailing days. Dangerous, they were."
3573="Do ye reckon you're dangerous as well?"

4003="They say a bartender is just a pharmacist with a limited inventory..."
4004="What can I get started for you?"
4005="Just give me the word and I'll pour you a glass of something strong."
4006="It's good to see you.  Now what can I get for you?"
4007="As long as you've got the coin, I've got the drinks."
4008="You look like you've seen better days.  Let's fix that."
4009="What would you like?"

4010="Excuse me sir!"
4011="It looks like it's your first time in."
4012="If you'd kindly set your weapon aside, your first drink will be on the house."
4013="And trust me,  you're going to want one."


4020="First one is on the house. What can I get you?"

4021="This one's on me.  What can I get you?"

4030="Sorry sir, no weapons allowed at the bar."
4031="Weapons are forbidden at the bar sir, please place that somewhere else."
4032="My apologies sir, I can't serve you unless you're unarmed."

4040="It seems you've done some damage to the Mansion."
4041="Your bill is "
4042="I'll go ahead and take that payment."
4043=" coins."
4044="Now then.  What can I get for you?"
4045="One moment please..."

4046="Maybe a drink would ease your pain."
4047="What'll you be having?"
4048="What're you buyin'?"
4049="A drink, sir?"
4050="Something to take the edge off?"
4051="You stare into the bottle long enough..."
4052="What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. A drink, sir?"
4053="Every profound spirit needs a mask. What can I get you?"
4054="Without spirits, life would be a mistake, eh?"

4055="You've made it this far... You're stronger than you look."
4056="This is the last time I'll serve you. Please, a drink."
4057="You've come a long way. It's my honor to serve you one last time."
4058="Well my friend, this is it. A drink in your honor."
4059="You're almost at the end... One more drink to ease the pain."


4500="Welcome, Otxo."
4501="Do you know why we, the denizens of this place, call your kind otxo?"
4502="It means wolf. Because that's what you are... A rabid, violent, helpless beast."
4503="A starving dog only in that condition because you turned your nose at the generous offerings of others."
4504="In short, pathetic."
4505="But it is not my place to judge..."
4506="I am a Nun with the Church of Steel, an organization dedicated to the procurement and upkeep of firearms."
4507="As the only apostle of the Church here, the Mansion has granted me some... unique privileges."
4508="Through me you may choose, with some exceptions, what firearms will appear within the Mansion."
4509="Of course, they will be wielded by your enemies. So be aware you may be choosing the firearms that kill you."
4510="And if you acquire any new weapons they too will join the list."
4511="Understand, my child? Good. Speak to me whenever you'd like to adjust your armory."

4512="Let us view your weaponry."

4513="Well well well Otxo."
4514="You've done a fine job collecting weaponry."
4515="The Church of Steel smiles upon such rigorous devotion, and as such have permitted me to grant you a new tool."
4516="The Welwyn .32 will now be yours to use as you please."
4517="Maybe not the most powerful weapon you'll ever encounter... and maybe not the fastest firing..."
4518="In fact, some would say it's quite difficult to use indeed."
4519="Regardless! It should be here the next time you stop by. You'll see it in the list."

4520="Blessed be the Church of Steel."
4521="Your armory, acolyte."

4522="Ah my child, the Church of Steel is pleased with your work."
4523="Your weapons..."

4524="The Church of Steel welcomes you with open arms."

4525="Your sins will be forgiven my child."
4526="All that matters now is your tools."

4527="Deadliness is next to godliness, as we say."
4528="But ones tools are only as deadly as they are..."

4529="Otxo, my child. Please view your weaponry."

4530="Blessings be upon you Otxo."
4531="Your armory awaits."

4532="A devotee to the Church of Steel shall be well equipped."
4533="Please Otxo, gaze upon your tools."

4534="Gunfire is the singing of angels, and the shooter is the conductor of the choir."
4535="Your instruments, my child."

4536="You will die, Otxo. But your are blessed with the gift to choose how."

5002="We were doing what we thought was right. We had to be."
5003="But you... you lead us astray. Not you, but... you know what I mean."
5004="How could we have known the outcome? How could we have known what would happen?"
5005="This place, this paradise... it has consumed us. And it continues to consume."
5006="You'll need to speak to the other one. In the motel."
5007="He knows how to get there... if you want to see what we've done."

5008="At long last someone has come to provide me company..."
5009="That thing has poisoned my mind. I cannot escape, I will never be free."
5010="It is too late for me. For all of us. We have committed too grave a sin."

5013="..."

5015="If... if you stay with me for just a while longer, I'll direct you there."
5016="Please, just a small reprieve from the solace."

5017="Okay... thank you. It is nice to have another living soul here, just for a little while."
5018="When you walk out that door, you'll be in His chamber."

6000="So you've made it this far..."
6001="I am the master of the Mansion."
6002="I am you."
6003="Maybe you don't remember coming to this place, controlling the Mansion..."
6004="Your mask darkening over time."
6005="But it doesn't matter now. Even if you kill me, you cannot destroy the Heart of the Mansion."
6006="This place is too powerful for you to stop at this point. It is futile to even try."
6007="You cut your way through your offshoots up to here, destroying everything in your path, and now you'll fall because you are not strong enough to finish this."
6008="Come on then, let's get this over with."

6009="Well, I certainly didn't expect one of you to make it this far."
6010="No matter. You cannot destroy the heart."


6011="Still going, huh?"
6012="Huh, didn't think you'd make it this far."
6013="Why are you trying so hard?"
6014="Do you really think you can change anything?"
6015="You're wasting your time."
6016="If you think you can make it, you're wrong."
6017="Even if you do make it, what then?"
6018="Why don't you just give up?"
6019="Haven't you had enough?"
6020="This is all futile, in the end."
6021="You disgust me."
6022="Regardless of how much blood you shed, you'll always be worthless."
6023="Wouldn't it be easier to just stop?"
6024="Do you really think you're important in this place?"
6025="You're scared, I can see it in your eyes."
6026="You are your own humiliation."
6027="Your sins almost equal mine."
6028="Why don't you speak to me? Are you afraid?"
6029="How do you think this ends?"
6030="Maybe that gun would be best used on yourself."

6031="Time to send you back where you belong."

6500="Let's see what I can work on for you."
6501="Sorry, that's everything I can import. Thank you for your continued patronage."
6502="Excellent, you can have this now and I'll get the bar to start stocking this. Thank you."
6503="Well hello there."
6504="It's been a long time since the last one. Welcome to The Rose Room."
6505="We're a humble little establishment offering drinks to weary souls in need."
6506="My role here is to import new liquors for the bar."
6507="Even though the bar's stock is quite large, it's always nice to add some new drinks to the menu from time to time."
6508="You know, maybe we can help each other. The importing cost is quite high, higher than I would be able to pay alone."
6509="If you could bankroll some of the importation fees, I'd be able to find some more drinks to import for you."
6510="That way you can permanently add new liquors to the bar's stock, which you may be served the next time you're here."
6511="And if you do pay the full importation fee, you'll be able to have the drink immediately, as a little added bonus."
6512="What do you say? Pretty good deal, no?"
6513="Just speak to me if you'd like to take a look at the list."

6514="I've got some imports here you may be interested in."

6515="I'll put your investment to good use. Shall we take a look?"

6516="Let's check the progress of your imports."

6517="Time to get down to business, hm?"

6518="Let's turn that coin into something you can use."

6519="I've got a good handful of options here for you."

8007="And it is my duty to collect and display them for you."

8018="Sorry, sorry... These rooms have been the object of my study for some time."
8019="I've taken to calling them Misplaced Chambers. I'm still not sure what causes them."
8020="My theory is that they're places the Master has visited, and that the Mansion has then absorbed."
8021="But they could also be the Master's memories made real by the Mansion. Or maybe not even be real at all."
8022="Needless to say, there's a lot of studying that needs to be done."

8023="Otxo! Yes yes, your collection awaits!"

9000="THE WRIT OF BEKATUA: Passage 1"
9001="In the Time Before, an entity named Bekatua set out to create a home away from the chaos of life."
9002="This was the initial impetus behind the creation of The Mansion."
9003="Bekatua, satisfied with its new home, lived in comfort for millenia."
9004="But that comfort came with boredom, as the doldrums of its unchanging home set in."
9005="There was no surprise, nothing new, because it was simply the world it had created."
9006="So Bekatua decided to test the limits of its ambition in its old age."

9007="THE WRIT OF BEKATUA: Passage 2"
9008="Bekatua's plan was to create something its perfect world did not have: chaos."
9009="This would be accomplished with two things. The first: impulse, the need to act."
9010="The second: violence, the need to change."
9011="The first was achieved with Bekatua's creation of The Mask, which would pull entities from other worlds."
9012="That way The Mansion would be populated with new viewpoints and new ideas."
9013="The second was achieved with a device known as The Firearm, which only Bekatua controlled."

9014="THE WRIT OF BEKATUA: Passage 3"
9015="Bekatua was immediately pleased with the results of its ambitions."
9016="The Mansion was soon populated with entities from other places and times, who formed a strong community."
9017="Some of them chose to worship Bekatua as a god, others chose to simply live out their lives here."
9018="The Mask did its job dutifully and every new day Bekatua was joyfully surprised."
9019="No longer did the boredom of a perfect world make every day the same."
9020="However, not unlike its creator, The Mask soon became overwhelmed with ambition."

9021="THE WRIT OF BEKATUA: Passage 4"
9022="Although The Mask knew and understood the reason for its creation, it felt it could not sit idle."
9023="It could not shake the feeling that maybe there could be more."
9024="It dreamed of a Mansion even greater than this one, larger and more resplendent."
9025="Instead of a small community, a grand city."
9026="A place where Bekatua and The Mask would truly have power."

9027="THE WRIT OF BEKATUA: Passage 5"
9028="But when The Mask approached Bekatua, Bekatua's ego would not allow it see its ambitions as worthwhile."
9029="Dejected and ashamed, The Mask instead became devious."
9030="It pulled in more and more entities from the outside, increasing the population of the community."
9031="Soon, as with any growth, the community began infighting."
9032="Every day the strife and anxiety of the community rose, but Bekatua did not know how to keep it in check."
9033="For Bekatua did not see itself as a leader of the community, but simply as a denizen of this place."

9034="THE WRIT OF BEKATUA: Passage 6"
9035="The community eventually turned on itself."
9036="Some blamed each other for the issues they were facing."
9037="But a strong contingent began to blame Bekatua, a thought which spread like wildfire."
9038="In a fit of rage the community rose up against Bekatua and cornered it within The Mansion."
9039="Refusing to use The Firearm to defend itself, Bekatua sat idly while the mob whipped itself into a frenzy."
9040="One member of the community eventually snatched The Firearm from Bekatua's hands."
9041="Quickly The Firearm was turned on Bekatua and utilized."
9042="And so, Bekatua was killed."


9043="THE WRIT OF BEKATUA: Passage 7"
9044="As soon as Bekatua fell, The Mansion shuddered and became unsteady."
9045="The Heart of the Mansion, the thing keeping this place in existence, was fueled by Bekatua."
9046="Without Bekatua The Heart was soon to die, and it would take The Mansion with it."
9047="The community was scared and immediately regretful for their actions."
9048="However, The Mask had accounted for this, and began implementing its plan."

9049="THE WRIT OF BEKATUA: Passage 8"
9050="The mob that had entered in order to face Bekatua turned to The Mask for guidance."
9051="But before they could even ask what they should do, The Mask struck them down."
9052="It was over in just seconds."
9053="Their blood, pooling across the room, soaked into the floorboards of The Mansion."
9054="From the floorboards it then soaked into the arterys of The Heart."
9055="And The Mansion settled."

9056="THE WRIT OF BEKATUA: Passage 9"
9057="The community of The Mansion shrank as they were used to fuel The Heart."
9058="The Mask found that it was able to use the corpses of those that had passed as soldiers."
9059="These husks roamed the halls of The Mansion, killing any who entered."
9060="Once the community had been depleted The Mask began travelling outside to collect entities."
9061="Compelled to put on The Mask, they were promised treasure, great luck, or a chance to see a loved one."

9062="THE WRIT OF BEKATUA: Passage 10"
9063="The Mask was able to prevent the entities it brought from truly dying, its only power in Bekatua's world."
9064="Even after they had spilled their blood within The Mansion they would wake up back on the beach."
9065="In this way, The Mask could continually milk its captives until they had nothing left to give."

9066="THE WRIT OF BEKATUA: Passage 11"
9067="Most of the community died out, with only a handful of stragglers and newcomers remaining."
9068="Those left of the community knew to stay outside of The Mansion."
9069="Meanwhile, The Mask continued to bring in fresh blood to fuel The Heart."
9070="And this is how it has been for some time."

9071="DAY 1"
9072="The most difficult thing is remembering how I got here."
9073="I think... I was at the park with my son. He asked me to push him on the swings."
9074="We were walking to the swingset when I saw a mask on the ground..."
9075="And some kind of force or something compelled me to pick it up and put it on."
9076="It's hazy, like a dream. I can't quite recall. But I heard my son crying for me, and then I awoke on the beach."
9077="I get the feeling he's inside this mansion. These folks outside have certainly indicated as such."
9078="No matter what, I'm going to get my son back and get out of here. Whatever it takes."

9079="DAY 2"
9080="Storming the mansion has so far proved fruitless. As soon as I get in there, I'm shot to pieces."
9081="The pain seems to be extremely real. But as I feel myself fade away, I awake back on the beach."
9082="The things in there don't seem to be entirely human. Maybe once, but not anymore."
9083="I feel no remorse killing them, thankfully. I know they're keeping me from my son."
9084="There's just so many of them. It's difficult to make it deeper in."
9085="All I can do is keep trying..."

9086="DAY 3"
9087="These people out on the beach are a strange lot."
9088="I feel like they know more than they're letting on, but at the same time, they don't seem to know much."
9089="The groundskeeper in particular seems to have fully accepted that this is his life."
9090="I don't understand it. Don't they want to get out of here? To go back to wherever they came from?"
9091="And that nun... I've never met a nun with such an obsession for firearms before."
9092="Strange woman."

9093="DAY 4"
9094="This is obvious, but I need to note it down in case I get out of here."
9095="I can't get the mask off."
9096="Try as I might, it simply won't come off. There's no straps, and as far as I can tell it's not glued on."
9097="It just... won't come off. That's all there is to it."
9098="It doesn't restrict my vision at all, so it's not a hindrance when I'm fighting in there."
9099="Furthermore, it seems like it's opaque on the outside, even though it's almost completely translucent inside."
9100="Regardless, I suppose I'm stuck with it."

9101="DAY 5"
9102="Despite being here as long as I have, it's occurred to me that I haven't gotten hungry yet."
9103="I don't believe I've gotten thirsty yet either, but I keep buying drinks from that bartender anyway."
9104="And as far as other bodily functions... well, haven't had any of those."
9105="It's like my body is in some kind of stasis. I don't even get tired in the traditional sense."
9106="I say it that way because as time has gone on, I've felt a sort of overall fatigue beginning to set in."
9107="Even though I rest, every time I awake on that beach it's progressed a little more."

9108="DAY 6"
9109="Time here seems to progress unusually. Every time I awake on the beach, it seems to be sunset."
9110="Last time, I stayed out on the beach for what felt like hours, just to watch the sun dip below the horizon."
9111="But it never did. It seems this place is eternally almost twilight."
9112="I've been marking the days by the amount times I've awoken on the beach. Even if it's not accurate, it's a decent count."

9113="DAY 7"
9114="I haven't written much about The Rose Room."
9115="I kind of cast it off at first, I figured that if I was going to fight, I shouldn't be intoxicated."
9116="But lately I've come to realize the drinks the bartender serves are... unique."
9117="Rather than make me drunk, they make me feel powerful."
9118="Now every time I enter the mansion, I make sure to grab a drink."
9119="As for the bartender himself... he's more of an enigma than anyone else here."
9120="It's like he exists just to serve. I tried asking him questions about the mansion, but he just stared at me."
9121="And that girl in there... I just don't know."

9122="DAY 8"
9123="I spent some time today outside of the mansion with the deviant."
9124="I hadn't noticed him at first, but when I finally did, I'm shocked that I didn't."
9125="He's got an unusually shaped skull. Insect like."
9126="Hell, he might be an insect. But he's awfully kind. One of the kindest here."
9127="He's rather obsessed with a collection of... something. I'm not entirely sure what he means."
9128="But he and I have talked at great length about my past life."
9129="He asked me a lot of questions about my son..."

9130="DAY 9"
9131="My son is in here. I can sense it."
9132="As I get further into the mansion, I can feel that I'm getting closer to him."
9133="But as I get further, there's more to battle through. It only gets harder."
9134="I can't give up.  I can't give up."

9135="DAY 10"
9136="I ran into a new figure in the mansion. A man like me, but his mask was red instead of white."
9137="He didn't have much to say that wasn't just downright cruel."
9138="I get the feeling he's like the bartender... maybe a product of this place, rather than a real person."
9139="Still, I don't know what his deal was."

9140="DAY 11"
9141="On my last attempt I went through a door that opened to an old arcade, just like the ones I visited as a kid."
9142="It felt strange to be in there. Something didn't feel right."
9143="For a moment I was overjoyed because I wasn't in the mansion any longer."
9144="But the arcade was empty and none of the machines worked."
9145="I remembered my conversations with the deviant. He had spoken about something like this before."
9146="He called them Misplaced Chambers. I guess they're not entirely outside the mansion, but not entirely within it either."
9147="Regardless... besides the strangeness of the room itself, there was an oppressive feeling in my head."
9148="It felt as if I didn't belong there."
9149="I walked out the front doors of the arcade hoping to find a sunny street in front of me."
9150="But I was simply back in the mansion."

9151="DAY 12"
9152="I don't know how many of them I've killed at this point."
9153="Hundreds... maybe even thousands?"
9154="And yet, it never ceases. I must continue until I've reached the end."
9155="Slowly, but steadily, I am reaching deeper into the mansion."
9156="I can make it. I have to make it. But this fatigue... this damn fatigue..."
9157="Every day I'm a little more tired. Weaker. Slower. I need to be fast. I need to be deadly."
9158="I'll finish this, even if I have to crawl."

9159="DAY 13"
9160="It appears that at the end of an area within the mansion, I will be forced into a room with a beast of some kind."
9161="There was that mechanical snake at first, but I've been able to handily dispatch that."
9162="But then there was that lizard, or maybe a gecko, made entirely of a black liquid, able to change shape at will."
9163="I don't know what the hell these things are or where they come from, but I suppose it matters not."
9164="They will die, like all the rest, until I've reached my son."

9165="DAY 14"
9166="The deviant and I sat together and watched the waves roll in for a while today."
9167="We spoke little, but I get the sense he enjoyed my company."
9168="I wonder, does the continual sunset look different through those compound eyes?"
9169="Is it astounding to see it a hundred different times at once?"

9170="DAY 15"
9171="Over two weeks now. Despite this fatigue, I can feel my skill increasing."
9172="I'm becoming faster, more agile, more accurate. More deadly."
9173="I can consistently get further in. I'm starting to see new areas."
9174="The girl at the bar has rewarded me with new drinks, new powers..."
9175="I think, for the first time here, I feel a glimmer of hope."
9176="I can do this. I can reach my son."

9177="DAY 16"
9178="I've been thinking about the mask."
9179="Although I was compelled to put it on, I don't feel it exercising any control over me here."
9180="Obviously I still can't remove it. But maybe its power isn't active here?"
9181="Every now and then I worry that it will suddenly take control, but at this point I've become confident."
9182="I am in control here. Despite the circumstances that have brought me here, I am all there is."

9183="DAY 17"
9184="Today I tried to leave for the first time."
9185="I didn't let myself at first, my goal was only to find my son, and then I would figure the rest out."
9186="But now that I've tried the mansion for some time, I took a look around the exterior."
9187="The beach stretches on for as far as the eye can see."
9188="I tried walking down it, and as soon as the mansion was out of sight behind me, it appeared in front of me."
9189="Behind the mansion is just an endless field of grass."
9190="I tried running out that way, and even though I was continually moving, I never got further from the mansion."
9191="And then there's the sea..."
9192="I haven't got a boat, and the few pieces of driftwood on the beach are waterlogged and useless."
9193="So it seems I'm stuck here. Not that I would leave my son behind anyways."

9194="DAY 20"
9195="I've skipped a few entries because nothing of note has occurred."
9196="I've been attempting the mansion every day but my earlier thoughts of progress seem to have been with fault."
9197="The further I get the more difficult it becomes."
9198="Deeper in there are new enemies, with different forms and abilities, who are stronger, faster..."
9199="Despite becoming more adept I fear that I'm beginning to reach my limit."

9200="DAY 26"
9201="I don't even know how deep into the mansion I must go."
9202="It could be infinite, for all I know."
9203="I can feel my son's presence as I push further in, but what if that's just a ruse?"
9204="It could be some kind of artificial feeling, it could be this damned mask..."
9205="And the worst of it all, I have no choice."

9206="DAY 30"
9207="Just about a full month now. The changes to myself have been curious."
9208="At first I was fueled by anger. I would find my son at all costs."
9209="That anger simmered to dedication. I would not give up."
9210="After a time, that dedication turned to despair..."
9211="But now I've been overcome with a certain curiosity about it all, which has greatly lifted my mood."
9212="I've had to decide that this endeavor is not impossible first and foremost."
9213="And then from there, I have had to create a strategy."
9214="What weapons do I find most effective? What drinks make me most powerful?"
9215="What strategies do I employ when facing certain enemies?"
9216="I've been writing down game plan strategies in the sand on the beach. They look like football plays."
9217="The deviant has been watching me, so I've been explaining my plans to him as I draw them out."
9218="He doesn't say much, but he does nod often, which I find reassuring."

9219="DAY 36"
9220="So far my planning has proved helpful. I've made it further into the mansion than ever before."
9221="I know what to expect. I move more confidently. My enemies fall before me in a shower of blood."
9222="Each firearm in there is unique, but I have learned the quirks and utility of every single one."
9223="I feel I have to be near the end. The fatigue is stronger than ever before, but I can still shrug it off."

9224="DAY 41"
9225="I think that man in the red mask... I think he's related to my mask somehow."
9226="I almost get the feeling the he IS my mask."
9227="Or it's possible that I'm simply going crazy."

9228="DAY 53"
9229="I snapped at the deviant today."
9230="He didn't do anything wrong, he was just being his normal self really. I apologized immediately."
9231="But the pressure of this place... I'm so tired and I'm beginning to lose hope."
9232="The exhaustion that I previously mentioned has strengthened to an alarming extreme."
9233="It's making it difficult to make attempts. It affects my speed... my aim..."
9234="I'm more reliant than ever on the bartender and his drinks."
9235="But even with them, I don't know how many attempts I have in me."

9236="DAY 59"
9237="I think I got close."
9238="I could feel my son so near to me, nearer than ever before."
9239="The room I was in had massive tears in the floor with nothing but space below."
9240="It was almost as if the mansion was starting to tear apart."
9241="Besides my son I could feel something else... like an overwhelming oppressive energy."
9242="But I couldn't reach far enough. I was so close but I couldn't do it."

9243="DAY 68"
9244="I saw the man in the red mask again."
9245="He taunts me and me alone. He thinks that I can't do this."
9246="He's getting under my skin... I tried to kill him."
9247="But something wouldn't let me pull the trigger. Not yet. Maybe I saw myself in him?"

9248="DAY 74"
9249="I've been wondering lately if any of this is real. How could a place like this exist?"
9250="But despite any questions of the material, I do know one thing. I am here."
9251="It's not a dream. I hurt, I bleed, I feel."
9252="Whatever this place is, I am trapped here. My son is trapped here."

9253="DAY 80"
9254="I've come to accept the conclusion I knew from the start, which is that this is all my fault."
9255="Not just picking up the mask that day in the park... but everything else."
9256="All the hurt I've caused my family. It all rests on my shoulders."
9257="Because I refused to try. I refused to do anything. I was convinced that it was my battle alone."
9258="And now, here in this place, not only have I been unable to save my son..."
9259="I've been unable to save myself."

9260="DAY 93"
9261="A long time ago I began to love the killing."
9262="At first it was a necessity. If I wanted to see my son, I would have to kill."
9263="I was appalled by the bloodshed and I pulled the trigger by duty alone."
9264="But now I enjoy it. The foes in there don't make any noise, but if they did I imagine I'd like their screams."
9265="Seeing their blood pool on the floor fills me with a sense of glee."
9266="I hate them. So naturally, I love it when they die."

9267="Day 100"
9268="This feels like it should be some kind of milestone, but it's not."
9269="In the last few attempts I haven't made much progress."
9270="The fatigue has permanently established itself in my body. I'm weak and getting weaker."
9271="I might be nearing the end of my rope."

9272="DAY 112"
9273="My son, if you ever read this, I'm sorry."
9274="This could have all been prevented and it's my fault."
9275="I've tried to get you out of here but I just can't..."
9276="I just can't..."

9277="DAY 117"
9278="I sat with the deviant for a long time today."
9279="I told him of my struggles. He listened, quietly and calmly."
9280="At one point I broke down and began sobbing."
9281="He laid a hand on my shoulder, then leaned in and said that I've done all I can."
9282="Is that it then? I won't get out of here, I won't save my son?"
9283="We're doomed to an eternity in this place?"
9284="I asked him these questions, and he simply nodded in silence."
9285="I exploded. I struck him and screamed at him."
9286="He couldn't possibly understand what it's like for me. He couldn't possibly understand the pain."

9287="DAY 118"
9288="The deviant wouldn't speak to me today. None of them would."
9289="I tried to apologize to him but he simply looked away."
9290="I'm truly alone in this place now. It's just me and the monsters in the mansion."

9291="DAY 127"
9292="None of the others will say a word to me."
9293="The only one who speaks to me now is the one in the red mask."
9294="He still chastises me for trying, and now I'm truly wondering why I'm trying at all."
9295="There's no way I can succeed at this point. We're trapped here, we're truly trapped here."
9296="Every day I'm becoming weaker. Soon I won't be able to go on at all."
9297="A bullet will put a hole through my head and I won't wake up on the beach, I know it."

9298="DAY 136"
9299="Instead of going into the mansion today, I simply sat in the sand and counted the hours go by."
9300="It was quiet. I'm not sure where the others had gone but I was alone there."
9301="I don't think I can do this anymore."

9302="DAY 138"
9303="How long will I have to struggle?"
9304="Over four and a half months of struggling. And yet nothing has changed."
9305="In fact, it's only gotten worse. I'm exhausted, the fatigue is killing me."
9306="The others outside the mansion have turned their back on me, which is my fault."
9307="And despite my efforts, I've been completely unable to get further into the mansion."
9308="I think I hit my peak a month or so ago..."
9309="It's just not possible anymore."

9310="DAY 145"
9311="In a way, I've become at peace with it all."
9312="I've realized that ever since I've arrived here, it's always been impossible."
9313="No matter how hard I would have tried there is no chance I would have made it."
9314="There is simply no route to happiness for me. I am doomed to this."
9315="And with that understanding comes tranquility."

9316="DAY 151"
9317="I am more fatigued than I have ever been."
9318="It's a struggle to even lift my rifle, let alone withstand the kick."
9319="I think my time here has come to an end. My next entry will be my last."

9320="DAY 155"
9321="I am sure of it now, the next time I die in there will be the last. I won't awake on the beach."
9322="So before I enter the mansion, I want to write a few things."
9323="To my son, I'm sorry to cause you such pain. You deserve better."
9324="I have failed you as a father and as a man. I tried for your sake, but I was not strong enough."
9325="To the others on the beach, I'm sorry for my decorum. I did not treat you all with respect."
9326="The truth is I just cannot take this any longer. The fatigue has left me so weak that I feel death imminent."
9327="I tried so hard, and for so long, and it all amounted to nothing."
9328="I have no choice but to accept that my time has come."
9329="Hopefully a bullet entering my skull will be the last pain I feel."
9330="I am truly, truly sorry."

9331="we love it yes we do we love it yes we do we love it yes we do we love it yes we do we love it yes we do"

9503="And I have something of an... accord, with the Mansion."
9504="I can offer you changes to your experience inside there."
9505="Some more difficult, some easier, some... just unusual."
9506="Speak to me if you'd like to see."
